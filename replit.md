## System Architecture

### Core Product Positioning
Nanny-AI is positioned as an **Intelligent Business Orchestrator** that humanizes AI for everyday users. This emphasizes automatic coordination of tasks/people/information, simple language interfaces without technical jargon, and transparent control that empowers non-technical users.
