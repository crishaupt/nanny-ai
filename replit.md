## System Architecture

### Core Product Positioning
Nanny-AI is positioned as an **Intelligent Business Orchestrator** that humanizes AI for everyday users. This emphasizes automatic coordination of tasks/people/information, simple language interfaces without technical jargon, and transparent control that empowers non-technical users. The core approach is "Coordinate, Simplify, Empower," where AI orchestrates work behind the scenes, translates complexity into plain language, and users maintain full control through transparent, easy-to-understand options.

### Four Core Principles
1.  **Human in Control**: User retains accountability with approvals and undo options.
2.  **Orchestrate, Don't Replace**: AI coordinates work behind the scenes while users focus on judgment and strategic decisions.
3.  **Transparent & Explainable**: All outputs show sources, reasoning, trade-offs, and limitations in simple language.
4.  **Responsible by Design**: Built-in guardrails for privacy, fairness, and harm prevention.
