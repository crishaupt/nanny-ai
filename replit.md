# Nanny-AI Website

## Overview

Nanny-AI is a human-centered AI copilot platform that proposes, previews, and explains assistance on routine work while leaving decisions, edits, and final actions firmly in the hands of the user. The website positions Nanny-AI as an augmentation tool (not replacement) that helps businesses handle everyday tasks through suggestions, summaries, and draft automations with clear approvals, transparency, and rollback capabilities. The core value proposition focuses on maintaining human control and accountability while leveraging AI to improve productivity, quality, and skill development across communication, meetings, research, workflow, data analysis, and learning activities.

## Core Product Positioning

### The "Propose, Preview, Explain" Approach
1. **Propose**: AI suggests assistance based on context without executing anything
2. **Preview**: User reviews AI output before anything happens, with full edit control
3. **Explain**: AI provides plain-language explanations with visible sources and limitations

### Four Core Principles
1. **Human in Control**: Approvals, undo, and "appropriate friction" at key moments keep accountability with the user
2. **Augment, Don't Replace**: AI handles drafting and retrieval while users focus on judgment, creativity, and higher-value work
3. **Transparent & Explainable**: All outputs show sources, context, and model limitations for informed decisions
4. **Responsible by Design**: Built-in guardrails aligned to privacy, fairness, and harm prevention
